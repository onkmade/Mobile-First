# Mobile-First
an approach to website and app development that prioritizes creating the user experience for mobile devices first!


We will build the mobile-first design using HTML for the foundational content, CSS for the mobile-first presentation, and JavaScript for enhancing functionality. The process involves starting with a content-rich HTML base, styling it for small screens first with CSS, and then layering on more features for larger devices using @media (min-width: ...) queries. JavaScript is only added later to implement non-essential behaviors, ensuring the core experience remains accessible and fast for every user.
